		                        <p class="lead">Tower of Hasan<br><br><a href="https://thinkmorocco.com/things-to-do-in-rabat/">
		                    The tower of Hasan is the most characteristic historical building of Rabat</a> and the one that is a must for your visit to the city. You might think that you are in front of the ruins of a mosque. But you don't. In fact, the Tower of Hassan in Rabat is what could have been the minaret of one of the largest mosques in the world at the time. Construction began in the 12th century under Sultan Ya'qub al-Mansur, but when he died, work stopped. Today we see a large number of low columns, along with the tower that should have measured 60 meters and remained at 44.<br><br>The Mausoleum of Mohamed V<br><br>Right in the same square where the tower of Hassan is located, you will see the Mausoleum of Mohamed V. This building is recent, from 1961. You can visit the interior for free. As you may have guessed, inside is the tomb of King Mohamed V. This king is considered "the father of the modern Moroccan nation". But there are also those of his two sons: Hassan II and Mulay Abdellah.<br><br>Necropolis of Chellah<br><br>The necropolis of Chellah is where what is now Rabat began to be forged. It is located 2 kilometers from the center of the city of Rabat. It is located in the ancient city of Sal√©. These Roman and medieval archaeological remains are the oldest in Rabat. Although they are not in the best condition, they are worth a visit.<br><br>The Medina of Rabat<br><br>Like most cities and towns in Morocco, we can also find in Rabat a medium sized town or an old town. There is no lack of souks with their stalls and alleys. But perhaps it is more similar to the streets of some place in Andalusia where the Arabs were than to other medinas in the country. This is because it was built more or less on a par with other cities in southern Spain.<br><br>The Kasbah of the Udayas<br><br>The Kasbah of the Udayas of Rabat is the old citadel of the city which also served as a military fortress. Walking around its blue and white streets will make you forget that you are in a big city to transport you to a small Moroccan village. Moreover, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO not long ago, in 2012.<br><br>Leaving the historic centre<br><br>Ville Nouvelle or New Town<br><br>A walk through the Ville Nouvelle in Rabat is a journey through the city's French colonial past. This is where the buildings of the French protectorate in Morocco are located. The Avenue of Mohamed V is the main avenue in this area and it is sure to relax you as you walk through it.<br><br>Walk along the coast<br><br>Didn't you notice that Rabat is on the coast? From the same city you can reach the beach right away, where you can take a quiet walk on it. You can go as far as the lighthouse, where the views of the beach and the sea are pleasant.<br><br>However, on hot summer days, the beach is filled with umbrellas and families from Rabat who come to spend the day at the beach. If this is the case, you may want to get a little further away and go to one of the beaches a little further away from the city. A good option is to go to Kentira beach.&nbsp;<br></p>
